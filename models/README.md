## Sample Models

Included in this folder are a collection of open source models and
some scripts to build TensorRT engines from these models.

TODO: update scripts to pull open sourced weights for fully functional
models.  Currently, the samples provided only generate TensorRT engines
with random weights and are only good for synthetic tests.
