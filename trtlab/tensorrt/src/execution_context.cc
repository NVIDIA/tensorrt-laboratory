 *
 * Note: It is critically important that Reset() is called if the ExecutionContext is not going to
 * be immediately deleted after use.  Most high-performance implementation will maintain a
 * queue/pool of ExecutionContexts.  You mush call Reset() before returning the ExecutionContext to
 * the pool or risk deadlock / resource starvation.
 *
 * Note: Timing is not implemented yet.  When implemented, do so a the host level and not the GPU
 * level to maximize GPU performance by using cudaEventDisabledTiming.  We don't need super accurate
 * timings, they are simply a nice-to-have, so a reasonable approximation on the host is sufficient.
